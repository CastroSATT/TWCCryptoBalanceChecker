This is the Worst Coded Crypto Balance Checker

I started off trying to make one thing and it turned into another 

This Balance Checker will activate said code depending on the variables that has been set up during the initial configuration process.... I have also included a QrCode .svg whizh will alow you to export a picture of your Crypto adress in QRformat

Ok! Why you Ask?

well for example you want to except BTC on an arcade machine or have a door that opens when etc etc 

in my example an arcade machine 

-Run the software 
-Watches BTC address
-btc address pings
-software sends ping to arduino via serial
-arduino sends credit up via physical replay
-And then the circle of life starts again
