This is the Worst Coded Crypto Balance Checker

I started off trying to make one thing and it turned into another 

This Balance Checker will activate said code depending on the variables that has been set up during the initial configuration process.... I have also included a QrCode .svg maker which will alow you to export a picture of your Crypto adress in QRformat

Ok! Why you Ask?

wel i wanted to start learning python and i had a few jobs doing so set abiut an easy way to make a switch 

well for example you want to except BTC on an arcade machine or to have a door that opens when etc etc 

in my example i have used an arcade machine 

-Run the software 
-make the configuration file
-software shuts down 

-launch software at startup
-Watches BTC address
-btc address pings
-software sends ping to arduino via serial
-arduino sends credit up via physical relay
-And then the circle of life starts again


ok so where do i start?

run the program for the first time and it will create a cfg.ini file if it finds one it will try to use the config file to run 

if you want to reset the software just "DELETE" the "cfg.ini" and the software will try and build and bew cfg file from fresh again 

which coins are supported?

-The Current supported list of cryptocurrencys 
 ['btc','dash','zec','doge','ltc']
